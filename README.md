# Mondrian-Project
This project is an HTML and CSS implementation of Piet Mondrian's art style, known for its abstract compositions of primary colors and rectangular shapes. The web page utilizes CSS grid layout to accurately replicate Mondrian's composition. The grid consists of various-sized rectangles, each assigned a specific background color to mimic Mondrian's color palette.

The layout follows the principles of Mondrian's art, with the use of vertical and horizontal lines to divide the canvas into smaller sections. The colors used in this replication include red, blue, yellow, white, and black, which were frequently employed by Mondrian in his artwork.

By examining the code and running the web page, viewers can gain an interactive experience of Mondrian's style and understand how the positioning and coloring of rectangles contribute to the overall aesthetic of his compositions.

This project serves as a tribute to Piet Mondrian and his contributions to abstract art. It also demonstrates the power of HTML and CSS in replicating artistic styles and creating visually appealing web designs.
